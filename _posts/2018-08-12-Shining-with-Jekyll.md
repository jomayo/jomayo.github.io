 I'm new to the development game but after spending significant time on a Wordpress site....I'm much happier to build a static site using Jekyll. Creating formatted content & layout w/ frontmatter feels easier & site is  faster than on Wordpress. That said, I know WP has a large community,  large library of plug-ins and I know it's relatively simple to use; It still feels easier, to this noob, to build and maintain than WP. But again....I'm new. Maybe it's 'cause I'm more interested in how interweb things work?? Hmm. Could be.
