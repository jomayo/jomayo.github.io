 Hey there! I'm working through the Learn Enough series; this is my first crack at building a blog site from scratch. So far I've found both Learn Enough HTML and Learn Enough CSS/Layout to be excellent at filling in gaps of my knowledge. For the record I have no idea how it compares to a code academy; I am self taught w/tips of the hat to Lynda, Udemy, One Month and more. Maybe I shouldn't have completed the Rails tutorial first??? ( *finished before there was a such thing as the Learn Enough Courses). I look forward to their Ruby and Sinatra Courses. buuut next time I start something it won't be on a monday morning..... I keep missing details as I code; side effects courtesy of post weekend/a.m. caffeine deficiency. :-)

My goal is simple: complete the Learn Enough Series. I went through MH's Rails tutorial a couple years ago...and on the strength of that I look forward to  Learn Enough Ruby/Sinatra. Technical Sophistication, here I come!
