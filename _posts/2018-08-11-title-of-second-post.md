 Hey there! Welcome to my first blog site courtesy the Learn Enough series.  Learn Enough HTML and Learn Enough CSS/Layout have been excellent at breaking down step by step why-pros-do-it-this-way web development. 

 It might not be everything but it's everything I need for now (to absorb)Kinda wish I'd found them first! That said I have no idea how it compares to a code academy; I'm self taught w/tips of the hat to Lynda, Udemy, One Month etc. In hindsight I'm not sure how I managed to complete the Rails Tutorial first??? (finished before the Learn Enough Courses were established).

  I can't wait until they roll out Learn Enough Ruby & Sinatra buuut I've slowly realized web development is an always-be-learning full-contact sport.

 Sometimes it been  really difficult when I wasn't sure what to Google or where to Google. Whew! Good thing I like learning. Shout out to StackOverflow! Anyway I hope this Monday treats you well! Neophyte development tips are always welcome.

 Technical Sophistication, here I come!
